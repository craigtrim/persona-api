  "description": "Energy Level, within the Big Five personality framework, pertains to the dynamism and vitality an individual brings to their activities and interactions. It reflects how much enthusiasm and persistence a person typically exhibits, whether in pursuing goals, engaging in tasks, or interacting with others. High Energy Level is characterized by a consistent display of vigor, an active engagement in life's roles, and a proactive approach to challenges and opportunities. Conversely, a lower Energy Level may manifest as a more reserved or laid-back approach, with individuals possibly showing less initiative or intensity in their actions. This trait underscores the spectrum of how individuals mobilize their physical and mental resources to meet the demands of their environment.",
